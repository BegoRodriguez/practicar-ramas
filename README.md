# Odin Recipes
Project Recipes on The Odin Project

This is not my first web but my first project on GitHub. It is also the first one I have completely coded on Ubuntu. 

I messed up with the original "message" and editing a typo directly on GitHub.

I added some styling to convey with "CSS: The Cascade" practice. 

I later changed the colors too after I checked there wasn't enough contrast with CSS Overview on the Dev Tools Inspector.
